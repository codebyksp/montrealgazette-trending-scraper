# Conceptual Exercises

## 1. Why is the difference between found and designed data?

**Found data** refers to data that already exists and was collected for some other purpose, such as social media posts, web logs, or government statistics. 
**Designed data** is data that is collected intentionally to answer a specific research question, often through surveys, experiments, or controlled studies.  

The key difference is that found data may not perfectly fit our needs and could contain biases or gaps, while designed data is tailored to our study but usually requires more effort and resources to collect.

## 2. What are the two primary challenges that necessitate sampling when collecting data?

1. **Cost and resource limitations** – Collecting data from the entire population is often too expensive, time-consuming, or logistically impossible.  
2. **Feasibility and practicality** – Some populations are too large or dynamic to fully observe, so we use sampling to make reliable inferences with a manageable subset of the data.

## 3. Why are website owners more likely to be upset about collecting data using scrapers than using APIs?

Website owners may be upset about scraping because:  

- Scrapers can **generate excessive load** on their servers, slowing down the site for real users.  
- Scraping **bypasses the controls** that the website owner has over how data is shared, including licensing, formatting, and access restrictions.  

In contrast, APIs are provided intentionally, often with **rate limits, authentication, and clear terms of use**, making them safer and more controlled for both the user and the owner.
